**Composable ZK Proof Circuits for Noir-based Applications**

Proofmesh is a modular, reusable ZK circuit registry and SDK built on Noir.
It enables DApp developers to plug-and-play standardized circuits, generate proofs in the browser, and verify them across chains like Ethereum and Starknet and Aztec.

- Built for NoirHack 2025  
- SDK: `@proofport/sdk`  
- Circuits: Open, versioned, and spec-compliant  
- Proofs: Generated entirely in-browser
